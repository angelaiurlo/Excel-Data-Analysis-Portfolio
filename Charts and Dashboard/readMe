# Charts and Dashboard
In this project, I learned how to create Charts and Dashboards in Microsoft Excel using sales data from a sample company. 
I used PivotTables to look at discrete trends in the data, which I will then represent as line, bar, and pie charts. 
Towards the end of the project, I summarized the sales data creating a dashboard composed of the charts and tables to provide a global picture of the sales data.
