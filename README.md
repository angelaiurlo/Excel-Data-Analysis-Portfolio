# Excel-Data-Analysis-Portfolio
This repository showcases a collection of Excel portfolio projects undertaken during my exploration of advanced Excel functionalities. These projects served as invaluable learning tools, allowing me to solidify my understanding of the software's capabilities and push its boundaries.

# Cleaning Data

## Project - 

In this project, I cleaned the data of different sample datasets. I removed duplicate, inaccurate data, and empty rows. I dealt with inconsistencies and used the Flash Fill feature and different functions to manipulate and standardize data.
Each datasheet contains both raw and manipulated data in order to verify the process.

# Charts and Dashboard

## Project - Product sales analysis

In this project, I created Charts and Dashboard in Microsoft Excel using sales data from a sample company. 
I used PivotTables to look at discrete trends in the data, which I will then represented as line, bar, and pie charts. 
Towards the end of the project, I summarized the sales data creating a dashboard composed of the charts and tables to provide a global picture of the sales data.
